        //  The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is an execution environment for .NET apps.
        //  The CLR is responsible for bringing apps to life, managing their execution and destruction.
        //  It is also responsible for handling recovering from an error.
        //  The CLR manages the following:
        //  - Memory Management
        //    - Tracks the objects and memory you are requesting.
        //    - Handling garbage collection, the destruction of unused objects.
        //
        //  - Operating System & Hardware Independence  
        //    - The CLR is similar to a virtual machine, such as the JVM.
        //    - Was designed to support multiple languages C#, VB.NET, F# or Python.
        //    - Available for pretty much every version of Windows since XP.
        //    - Runs on desktop, server and mobile and is processor agnostic.
